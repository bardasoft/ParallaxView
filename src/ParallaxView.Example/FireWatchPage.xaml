The game was released in February 2016 for Linux, OS X, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in September 2016, and for Nintendo Switch in December 2018. The story follows a fire lookout named Henry who works in Shoshone National Forest. Henry interacts with his supervisor Delilah using a walkie-talkie, with the player choosing from dialog options to communicate. His exchanges with Delilah inform the process by which their relationship is developed. Over the course of the summer, Henry and Delilah appear to be menaced by unseen forces and have to unravel a years-old mystery."

The player's choices will influence the tone of Henry's relationship with Delilah. As the story progresses, new areas will be opened up for the player, and certain events are set at different times of the day.[6] Objects found in the wilderness can be kept in the inventory for later use."
